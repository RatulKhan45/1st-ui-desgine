                During the 18th century, the Nawabs of Bengal became the region's de facto rulers. The ruler's title is
                 popularly known as the Nawab of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, given that the Bengali Nawab's realm encompassed
              <br>    much of the eastern subcontinent. The Nawabs forged alliances with European colonial companies, making the
                <br>   region relatively prosperous early in the century. Bengal accounted for 50% of the gross domestic product
                    of the empire. The Bengali economy relied on textile manufacturing, shipbuilding, saltpetre production,
                     craftsmanship, and agricultural produce. Bengal was a major hub for international trade â€“ silk and cotton
                      textiles from Bengal were worn in Europe, Japan, Indonesia, and Central Asia.[77][56] Annual Bengali 
               <br>       shipbuilding output was 223,250 tons, compared to an output of 23,061 tons in the nineteen colonies of
                       North America. Bengali shipbuilding proved to be more advanced than European shipbuilding before the
                       Industrial Revolution. The flush deck of Bengali rice ships was later replicated in European shipbuilding 
                <br>       to replace the stepped deck design for ship hulls.[76][78][79][80][81][82]


Lalbagh Fort was the residence of the Mughal viceroy Shaista Khan
 <br> The Bengali Muslim population was a product of conversion and religious evolution,[56] 
and their pre-Islamic beliefs included elements of Buddhism and Hinduism.

        <div>The Mughals had aided France during the Seven Years' War to avoid losing the Bengal region to the British. However, in the Battle
          <br>  of Plassey the British East India Company registered a decisive victory over the Nawab of Bengal and his French[86] allies on 22 
           <br> June 1757, under the leadership of Robert Clive. The battle followed the order of Siraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of
           <br> Bengal, to the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the
